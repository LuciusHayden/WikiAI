# WikiAI

# Author
Hello, my name is Lucius, this is the first project ive made using a frontend as well as a backend, the frontend is made using Angular (which is coded in typescript), while the backend is made using Python, im using Flask for the API. I have a youtube channel that has some of my projects on it if you want to check it out.

# Features

Its really quite simple, input a wikipedia url and a question, the openai api will process the question with the references in the wikipedia as context and return a response with the source attached. 

- only allows wikipedia urls (filters out references that arent urls)

- Frontend in Angular (typescript)

- Backend in Flask (python)

# Lessons learned

This project was my first full stack website, so I learned a lot about how to set up a API server and establish a connection beteween the frontend and backend, which is extremely useful to know and will help in future projects.
